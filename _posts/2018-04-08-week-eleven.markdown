<h3>What did I do this past week?</h3>
This week in OOP, we finished up discussing vectors by talking about how to enable our vector to use any user-defined allocator similarly to the real vector class and all other std containers. Speaking of other containers, we learned about the "workhorse" containers vector, deque, list, and how they are used by container adapters stack, queue, and priority queue. Finally, we wrapped up this week's lectures by talking about the associative containers set and map. For the Darwin project, my partner and I had already decided how we wanted the classes to be structures, and all we had to do was write the code. However, we ran into a nasty bug where our creature pointers were being lost whenever our vector of creatures was resized.

<h3>What's in my way?</h3>
My biggest struggle recently has been trying to find and fix the bug I just mentioned. Nothing I tried seemed to work, and I was getting random data whenever I tried to print stuff. However, these kinds of bugs are to be expected when first learning a language. With the projects, I have not been having much trouble with coming up with the correct algorithm, but the most difficult part is learning the inner workings of C++.

<h3>What will I do next week?</h3>
Next week, I plan on meeting with my partner after class on Monday to get an early start on the next project because my previous partner and I felt a little rushed towards the end with the last project because debugging took longer than expected. Another reason why we plan on starting so early is that we have heard that this last assignment is the most challenging and time-consuming.

<h3>What's my experience with the class?</h3>
I really like that this class is challenging enough to keep me engaged every lecture, but not so hard that I have trouble keeping up. In addition, I think the workload for this class is just right. It is not overbearing like operating systems, and it can be paired up with any other CS class.

<h3>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
My pick-of-the-week this week is Git Bash. It's a command-line shell that can be run on Windows to get most of the features of a unix terminal. Instead of having to install PuTTY to ssh, Git Bash is usually installed whenever you install git.
