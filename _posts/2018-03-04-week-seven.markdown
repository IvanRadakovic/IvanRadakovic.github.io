<h3>What did I do this past week?</h3>
This past week we started by learning about lambda functions that capture variables by value and by reference. We also got more practice with HackerRank exercises to help us prepare for the test. Other than that, we did not learn many new concepts but instead spent our class time reviewing old material. To prepare me for the midterm, the day of the exam, I went back through all the previous HackerRank exercises that we did in class. I forced myself to do them from scratch without looking at the solution. This sort of practice paid off because I was on the first couple people to finish the exam.  Also, right before the test, I tried to print my cheat sheet, but my printer was out of ink and I did not have time to replace the ink cartridge, so I took the test without the cheat sheet. This did not seem to matter because in making the cheat sheet, I memorized everything that was on it.

<h3>What's in my way?</h3>
Now that the midterm is behind me, I have nothing to worry about until after spring break.

<h3>What will I do next week?</h3>
I plan to read the next two chapters in the textbook and look at the  Interface Segregation Principle paper. After we go over project 3 in class on Monday, I will try to find a partner. Before spring break, I would like to have the dev environment set up and some progress on the project.

<h3>What's my experience with the class?</h3>
I am really enjoying this class but it might be the high from the exam speaking. I thought the test was fair because most of it was straight from the HackerRank exercises with minor twists. Although debugging while under stress was a little hectic. I did appreciate the fact that we were able to have a cheat sheet (even though I was not able to print mine) because we did not have to worry about memorizing some weird syntax (even though I did).

<h3>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
If you have ever needed to use Git, you might have noticed that it is really easy to use when you do everything correctly, but if you have had the misfortune of making a typo in your commit message, you know how unintuitive git becomes. Undoing things in Git is pretty tricky unless you know what you are doing, and it can also have devastating consequences. However, there is [this helpful guide](https://blog.github.com/2015-06-08-how-to-undo-almost-anything-with-git/) to help you undo (almost) anything with Git.
