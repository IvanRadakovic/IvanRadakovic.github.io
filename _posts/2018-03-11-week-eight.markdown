<h3>What did I do this past week?</h3>
This past week, we started talking about the next project we are working on. The allocator class we are making is supposed to mimic the allocator class form the C++ standard library by acting as a heap manager. We also discussed that the calls to allocate and deallocate are supposed to do as well as the method by which our allocator will keep track of empty and free blocks. We concluded the week by talking about what can go wrong when we have to manage our own memory such as deleting too early or even forgetting to delete.

<h3>What's in my way?</h3>
Although I am excited about spring break finally being upon us, it makes working on the project a little more difficult because my partner and I will not be in the same room. We plan on using an online editor that we both can edit, and voice chatting as we work on the project.

<h3>What will I do next week?</h3>
This week I plan on catching up on sleep and resting my ankle that I sprained this past weekend at my ultimate tournament. Also, my partner and I want to make some progress on the project over the break so we have less work to do over when we get back.

<h3>What's my experience with the class?</h3>
Even though I am really enjoying the class, the only thing I I would change is to make the quizzes less vague. Half the challenge is to figure out what the question is asking. This was really evident in the most recent quiz. It makes it more difficult because it usually takes reading a couple questions to really understand them and we cannot go back once we answer a question.

<h3>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
 My tip-of-the-week is the editor [Atom](https://atom.io/). I use it for all the projects because of the built-in Github integration, autocomplete, and the file browser. The best part is that if it does not have a feature you are used to having, it has a really easy to use package manager with thousands of community made packages.
