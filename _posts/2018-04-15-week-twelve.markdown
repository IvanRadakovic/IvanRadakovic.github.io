<h3>What did I do this past week?</h3>
This week, we discussed the Life project. Although I was already familiar with the "game" I have never implemented it before. In addition, we talked about inheritance and how C++ exhibits static binding by default in contrast to Java which is dynamically bound by default. In order to have dynamic binding in C++, you have to use the virtual keyword. However, this does not guarantee dynamic binding because it does not occur on an object, with a scope operator, in a constructor, nor in a destructor. Outside of class, my partner and I got a really early start on the project because we knew it was going to be time-consuming.

<h3>What's in my way?</h3>
In spite of the fact that my partner and I started on the Life project the first day it was assigned, the biggest concern that I have is whether or not we will have enough time to finish the project because this past week has been really busy. On top of the normal school work, I had an ultimate frisbee tournament all weekend, so I did not have any time to do any homework, let alone the project. As a result, this week I will be playing catch up.

<h3>What will I do next week?</h3>
This upcoming week, I plan on putting my foot on the gas and focusing up to get all the work done that I need to. My partner and I have a solid idea of what we are doing, we just need to finish implementing the code.

<h3>What's my experience with the class?</h3>
I am still enjoying this class a lot and the projects are fun. They remind me of programming competition problems I did in high school. Also, I like that I am forced to finally learn C++ because I have always meant to do it, but have never had the time.

<h3>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
My tip-of-the-week is to use a password manager because there is nothing less secure than using the same password or similar variations of a password on multiple websites. Even if it is the most secure password, all it takes is one account to be compromised, and then all your other accounts could be jeopardized. The best thing to do is to have a strong and unique password for every site, but all those passwords would be impossible to memorize. This is where a password manager comes in. You remember one password that unlocks all your other passwords. I recommend [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/), [1Password](https://1password.com/), or [SafeInCloud](https://safe-in-cloud.com/).
